⚠️ This project isn't finished. ⚙️ We are working on it.

## Project Description

With this zk-app developed on the Mina Protocol, a new layer of storage over the protocol is achieved, allowing users to be able to deploy secrets or files over the network, having the proof that each member with whom the secret is shared really only owns it.

Secrets in Vaultmi are encrypted and stored publicly, but distributed so that only the owners of the secrets can access them.

## How it's Made

Vaultmi is a zk-app that combines the decentralized storage of IPFS/Filecoin and Mina Protocol, this allows us to share files or secrets securely to multiple wallets as well as generate a Proof of Existence in the Mina protocol. With a friendly user interface and the integration of the Auro wallet it allows anyone to take advantage of this technology.
